# Flicks & Picks

Our web application, "Flicks & Picks", is a comprehensive movie platform that offers a rich and personalized user experience. The platform allows users to explore an extensive catalog of movies, obtain detailed information, share their opinions, and much more.

## Features

**Unregistered users** can freely browse the movie catalog, accessing basic information about each movie. In addition, they can perform advanced searches by title, description, genre, and rating, which makes it easier to find the perfect movie for their next viewing.

For those who want a more personalized experience, we offer the option to register on the platform. **Registered users** can rate movies, which not only allows them to share their opinions, but also contributes to the average rating of the movies shown to all users. In addition, they can manage their account, view and modify their personal information, and if they wish, they can delete their account.

But that's not all, our platform also has an **administrator** role. Administrators have the ability to manage the movie catalog, which includes adding new movies, editing existing information, and deleting movies. In addition, they can manage actors and directors, which allows keeping the catalog updated and relevant.

In summary, our movie web application offers a complete and personalized user experience, allowing users to explore, rate, and review movies, and administrators to manage the movie catalog and film personalities. With its wide range of functionalities, our platform is the perfect destination for movie lovers.
